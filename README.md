# MasterThesis
Scripts for the thesis


FitnessFunction: calculation of Sims-Flanagan and propagation to return the fitness function. (Old Version)

FitnessFunction_1loop: the optimization is performed at once. (Recent version)

FitnessFunction_normalized: FitnessFunction_1loop with normalized fitness function. (Current version)


main: associated to FitnessFunction. For more than 1 optimization loop

main_1loop: current version to call the fitness function and observe the results


StudyOptimization: study of parameters of EA

StudyOptimizationMBH: study of parameters of MBH self implemented


Test: validation of astrodynamics functions

TestOpt: validation of optimization functions


TrainingData: read and modify training data for the network

GenerateTrainingDataFromOpt: create file with training data labeled. Based on FitnessFunction_normalized. 


AstroLibraries: scripts for the optimization and astrodynamics algorithms.
